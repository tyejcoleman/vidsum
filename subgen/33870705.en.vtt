00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.850
RYAN DUFFY: Welcome to
Bogota, Colombia.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.980
We're here chasing after the
most dangerous drug in the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.420
world, burundanga.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.010
Burundanga is the source of
scopolamine, which is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.870
basically like the worst roofie
you can ever imagine

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.170
times a million.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.045
You're at the whim of
suggestions like, hey, take me

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:27.300
to your ATM.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.270
Hey, come with me to
the hotel room--

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.060
while you're completely
conscious and articulate.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.090
Apparently there is a lot of
different parts of the plant

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.230
that are a bit dangerous,
possibly a bit fun, depending

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.460
on what you're into.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.810
So we're going to be looking
for the tree, talking to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.770
people who've had experience
with it, and seeing if we can

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.280
find some of the actual
drug ourselves.

00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:17.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.530
RYAN DUFFY: So the deal with
burundanga is that it pretty

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.810
much eliminates your
free will.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.200
So you're awake and
you're articulate.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.760
And to anyone else watching
you, it seems like you're

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.970
perfectly fine.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.670
But you've completely lost
control of your own actions.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.490
So you're at the whim
of suggestions.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.750
And that's how people take
advantage of you.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.610
I've heard a bunch of different
stories really

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.060
running the gamut.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.810
Some of them sound like campfire
horror stories you're

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.920
told when you're growing up.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.310
Stuff like, waking up in a
bathtub with an organ cut out

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.760
and a sign saying, you
have five hours

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.190
to get to the hospital.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.280
We've of course also heard
that it's used

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740
as a date rape drug.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.720
We heard one particularly
chilling story where a guy was

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.190
taken back to his apartment,
woke up the next morning in an

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.070
empty apartment completely
confused as to what happened.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.789
Went down and said to his door
man, you know, why is my

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.789
apartment empty?

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.070
What happened?

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.050
The doorman said, well, you
brought it out with two of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.950
your friends last night.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.780
All your stuff, you loaded
it into a van.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.740
And the guy was like, why
in the hell would

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.080
you let me do that?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410
And he was like, because
you told me to.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.570
So that's kind of the stuff
we're dealing with here,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.290
complete elimination of free
will while still acting which

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.460
is pretty much the scariest
shit I can imagine.

RYAN DUFFY: Columbia's
basically fucked.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.090
They had the longest running
guerrilla war in

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.470
all of Latin America.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.550
They've essentially been at
civil war for 60 years.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.900
And really if you think about
it, they've never not been at

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.290
war since they gained their
own independence.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.630
Other fun facts about Colombia,
definitely not from

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.050
the Board of Tourism, include
the fact that one in every

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.370
three kidnappings in the world
happen right here in Colombia.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.210
And as we all know,
it's the cocaine

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.160
capital of the universe.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.940
RYAN DUFFY: Now the borrachero
tree, which by the way roughly

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.310
translates to drunken binge
tree, is indigenous to the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.490
Northern Andean region.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.600
That includes Colombia, and
Ecuador, Venezuela.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.720
But the scopolamine is really
only used by the criminal

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.940
element here in Colombia.

kidnapping, the narco
trafficking, the civil unrest,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.200
and everything else going on in
here in Columbia, we can't

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.570
seem to find a Colombian who's
more scared of anything than

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.640
falling asleep under the

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.960
The indigenous people in this

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.280
uses for the drug.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.500
For example, when a chieftain
died, all his assorted

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.280
females, wives, mistresses,
what have you, they

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.405

Now that could be a bit
of a dicey process.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.880
But what better way to shore
things up than to slip them

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.850
some scopolamine and suggest
they walk into a grave.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.010
When they did, they
were buried alive.

whole litany of fucked-up

scopolamine for their benefit.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.630
For example, in the 1930s and
'40s, Josef Mengele had the

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.060
drug imported from Columbia to
Germany to use in some of his

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.310
interrogations.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.530
More recently, the CIA tried
to use the drug in the '60s

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.200
during the Cold War as sort
of a truth serum.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.720
The problem with all of this is
that in addition to a whole

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.390

of hallucination involved.

RYAN DUFFY: So it seems like a
lot of the worst scopolamine

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.680
stories that we've heard
start and end at

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.810
places just like this.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.500
And the next thing we're able to
get from someone is, I woke

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.170
up on a park bench day and a
half later, without my clothes

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.981
on, without any money,
whatever it is.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.905
This drug has always been kind
of inextricably linked to sex

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:10.590
in some way or another.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.590
From its earliest uses, to
eliminating a lingering

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.440
mistresses, to fallen
chieftains, to its eventual

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.490
use in easing the pain of
childbirth, to the stories

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.750
we're hearing on the streets
today about prostitutes giving

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.820
it to unsuspecting johns, or
about men turning women into

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.800
prostitutes by suggesting they
go and earn some cash.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.590
It always seems to come back to
sex in one way or another.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.510
And it always seems to start
at places like this.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.760

RYAN DUFFY: So, so far we've
heard a lot of stories about

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.260
burundanga.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.030
But we'd like to get a
little bit closer.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.170
So we've asked some of our
Colombian friends to put us in

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.030
touch with someone who has an
experience with burundanga.

Not bummed to see it go, I'll
tell you that much.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.460
Like when I first got here I
was super interested in it.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.032
And it was like this
novelty thing.

00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:20.930
I've heard enough stories,
man, that I'm just not
